# 1. Advanced Feature Engineering

- **Incorporate Temporal Features:**
  - Time since last transaction.
  - Session-based metrics.
  - Recurring patterns and seasonal effects.
- **Create Aggregation Features:**
  - User-level and merchant-level statistics (mean, median, counts).
- **Feature Interactions:**
  - Polynomial features and cross-features between important variables.

# 2. Enhance Data Preprocessing

- **Address Class Imbalance:**
  - Use techniques like SMOTE, SMOTE-ENN, or class weighting.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal:**
  - Implement methods like Isolation Forest to clean the dataset.
- **Data Normalization:**
  - Apply `RobustScaler` or other scaling methods less sensitive to outliers.

# 3. Experiment with Different Algorithms

- **Alternative Models:**
  - Try LightGBM, CatBoost, or deep learning models.
- **Ensemble Methods:**
  - Implement stacking or voting classifiers to combine multiple models.

# 4. Hyperparameter Optimization

- **Automated Tuning:**
  - Use Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian optimization (e.g., Optuna).
- **Cross-Validation Strategies:**
  - Employ stratified or time-series cross-validation techniques.

# 5. Improve Model Evaluation

- **Use Appropriate Metrics:**
  - Focus on AUC-PR, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Cost-Sensitive Evaluation:**
  - Incorporate the costs of false positives and negatives into evaluation.

# 6. Enhance Model Interpretability

- **SHAP Values:**
  - Use SHAP for global and local interpretability.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:**
  - Perform permutation importance and analyze results.

# 7. Incorporate Anomaly Detection

- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - Utilize autoencoders or one-class SVMs to detect anomalies.
- **Semi-Supervised Techniques:**
  - Train models primarily on non-fraudulent data to detect deviations.

# 8. Address Concept Drift

- **Model Retraining Strategies:**
  - Schedule regular retraining with new data.
- **Drift Detection:**
  - Monitor model performance and data distributions over time.
