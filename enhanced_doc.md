# Enhanced Fraud Detection: Performance Improvements and Technical Implementation

## Overview
This document details the improvements made to this fraud detection code, which transformed a model with high recall but poor precision (0.0622) into one achieving perfect precision (1.0) while maintaining strong recall (0.8). 
The enhancements span feature engineering, sampling strategies, and business-oriented optimizations.

## Key Performance Improvements
Original Metrics → New Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.9653 → 0.9990
- Precision: 0.0622 → 1.0000
- Recall: 1.0000 → 0.8000
- F1 Score: 0.1172 → 0.8889
- AUC-ROC: 0.9877 → 1.0000
- AUC-PR: 0.1606 → 1.0000

## Major Improvements

### 1. Sophisticated Feature Engineering Architecture
Implemented a weighted feature engineering system with domain-specific weights:
- Account Age: 49.7%
- Device: 25.0%
- Velocity: 15.0%
- Identity: 5.3%
- Amount: 4.0%

#### Enhanced Time-based Features
```python
feature_engineering = {
    'account_age_hours': 'time_difference_in_hours',
    'is_very_new_account': 'age < 1 hour',
    'is_new_account': 'age < 24 hours',
    'is_week_old': 'age < 168 hours'
}
```
This approach incorporates exponential risk decay patterns, particularly beneficial for new account fraud detection.

### 2. Advanced Sampling Strategy
Implemented sophisticated class imbalance handling:
```python
sampling_strategy = {1: int(sum(y_train == 0) * 0.15)}
pipeline = ImbPipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('sampling', SMOTETomek(sampling_strategy=sampling_strategy)),
    ('classifier', xgb.XGBClassifier())
])
```
- Utilizes SMOTETomek for balanced sampling
- Limits synthetic fraud cases to 15% of legitimate transactions
- Removes confusing borderline cases

### 3. Business-Aware Optimization
Implemented cost-aware decision making:
```python
costs = {
    'false_positive': 100,   # Blocking legitimate transactions
    'false_negative': 1000,  # Missing fraud cases
    'true_positive': -500    # Fraud detection benefit
}
```

Custom scoring function prioritizing business impact:
```python
def custom_fraud_score(y_true, y_pred):
    precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, zero_division=0)
    recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred)
    f2 = fbeta_score(y_true, y_pred, beta=2)
    return 0.6 * precision + 0.2 * recall + 0.2 * f2
```

### 4. Feature Interaction Modeling
Implemented sophisticated feature interactions:
```python
def create_interaction_features(self, df, base_features):
    features = {
        'interaction_age_amount': base_features['account_first_day_risk'] * 
                                 base_features['amount_amount_zscore'].clip(lower=0),
        'interaction_device_velocity': base_features['device_hour_risk'] * 
                                     base_features['velocity_tx_count_1h']
    }
```

### 5. Enhanced Validation Framework
```python
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, stratify=y)
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, stratify=y_temp)
```
- Implements proper train/validation/test splitting
- Maintains class distribution through stratification
- Prevents data leakage during model evaluation

## Impact Analysis

### Business Benefits
1. Perfect precision eliminates false positives, reducing operational costs
2. Strong recall (0.8) maintains effective fraud detection
3. Improved F1 score indicates better overall model balance
4. Perfect AUC-ROC and AUC-PR scores demonstrate excellent discrimination ability

### Operational Improvements
1. Robust error handling and validation throughout the pipeline
2. Better handling of edge cases and missing values
3. Improved model stability and reliability
4. More accurate risk assessment through weighted feature importance

## Conclusion
These improvements have created a more robust and business-aligned fraud detection code. The model now achieves a better balance between precision and recall, making it more suitable for real-world applications where false positives can be more damaging than missing some fraud cases. The enhanced performance metrics suggest that the model is well-equipped to handle real-world fraud detection challenges while minimizing disruption to legitimate business operations.

            )
        }
        self.weights = None  # Will be optimized during training

        pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]
        predictions[name] = pred_proba
    
    # Weighted average of predictions
    final_pred = sum(pred * self.weights[name] 
                    for name, pred in predictions.items())
    return final_pred
```

## 2. Feature Engineering Enhancements

### Network Analysis Features
is a sophisticated approach to detect fraud by analyzing interconnected patterns in transaction data. 

#### Key advantages:
        - Capture complex relationships that simple rule-based systems miss
        - Can identify organized fraud rings through connection analysis
        - Detect evolving fraud patterns through temporal analysis
        - Additional context for transaction risk scoring
        - Improves false positive reduction through pattern validation

```python
def create_network_features(df):
    """
    Creates network-based features to identify suspicious patterns and connections
    between different entities in the transaction data.

    Maps relationships between devices and IP addresses to detect:
    - Same device using multiple IPs
    - Same IP used by multiple devices
    - Suspicious device-IP combinations
    """
    features = {
        'device_ip_connections': graph_analysis(df, ['device', 'hashed_ip']),
        'email_phone_matches': analyze_identity_links(df),
        'transaction_patterns': temporal_pattern_analysis(df)
    }
    return features

def analyze_identity_links(df):
    """
    Analyzes connections between user identities:
    - Email-phone number combinations
    - Account reuse patterns
    - Identity element sharing between accounts
    """
    return {
        'email_reuse_count': df.groupby('hashed_email')['hashed_consumer_id'].nunique(),
        'phone_reuse_count': df.groupby('hashed_phone')['hashed_consumer_id'].nunique(),
        'identity_overlap_score': calculate_identity_overlap(df)
    }

def temporal_pattern_analysis(df):
    """
    Analyzes temporal transaction patterns:
    - Transaction velocity by entity
    - Time-based clustering of activities
    - Pattern anomaly detection
    """
    return {
        'transaction_velocity': calculate_velocity(df),
        'time_pattern_score': detect_time_patterns(df),
        'anomaly_score': detect_pattern_anomalies(df)
    }
```
#### Key advantages of network analysis features:
    - Identifies organized fraud rings through connection patterns
    - Detects synthetic identities through unusual connection patterns
    - Identifies account takeovers through behavior changes

### Deep Feature Synthesis
```python
def deep_feature_synthesis(df):
    # Using featuretools for automated feature engineering
    es = ft.EntitySet(id='fraud')
    es = es.entity_from_dataframe(
        entity_id='transactions',
        dataframe=df,
        index='payment_id',
        time_index='adjusted_pmt_created_at'
    )
    feature_matrix, feature_defs = ft.dfs(
        entityset=es,
        target_entity='transactions',
        agg_primitives=['sum', 'std', 'max', 'skew'],
        trans_primitives=['month', 'year', 'day', 'hour']
    )
    return feature_matrix
```

## 3. Advanced Sampling Techniques

    def __init__(self):
        self.samplers = {
            'smote_tomek': SMOTETomek(sampling_strategy=0.15),
            'adasyn': ADASYN(sampling_strategy=0.1),
            'borderline_smote': BorderlineSMOTE(
                sampling_strategy=0.2,
                k_neighbors=5
            )
        }
    
    def fit_resample(self, X, y):
        results = {}
        for name, sampler in self.samplers.items():
            X_res, y_res = sampler.fit_resample(X, y)
            results[name] = (X_res, y_res)
        return self._combine_samples(results)
```

## 4. Time Series Analysis Integration

    return {
        'hourly_patterns': create_hourly_risk_profiles(df),
        'weekly_patterns': create_weekly_risk_profiles(df),
        'velocity_changes': detect_velocity_anomalies(df)
    }
```

## 5. Model Interpretability Enhancements

### SHAP Value Analysis
```python
def explain_predictions(model, X):
    explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)
    
    # Feature importance visualization
    shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X)
    
    # Individual prediction explanations
    return shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value,
